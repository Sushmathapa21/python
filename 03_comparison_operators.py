#comparison operators:

#equal (==)
x = "1"
y = 1
print(x ==y) # "False" - provides answer in the boolean form.

#another eg:
x = 1
y = 2
if (x==y):
    print("x is equal to y.")
else:
    print("x is not equal to y")

#not equal to (!=):
x = 3021
y = 3147
print(x!=y) # "True" because x is not equal to y.

#greater than and less than & greater than equal to and less than equal to(</> and <= / >=) only use in case of numbers and not in strings.
